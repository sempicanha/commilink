# Commilink Example: chat-and-to-and

This repository contains a basic example to demonstrate the principles of the **CMLK Protocol** using a simple HTML and Node.js chat.

> ⚠️ **Warning:** This example is for learning and study purposes only. It is **not production-ready**.

---

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed
- Live Server or any HTTP server to open HTML files locally

---

## How to Test

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sempicanha/commilink.git

cd commilink
node server.js
```


If you want, I can also make an **enhanced version in English** with badges, quick-start instructions, and highlighted code examples, still keeping it all in one file.  

Do you want me to do that?
